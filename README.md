# T9

Yet another solution to the T9 problem, but this time using elixir.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `t9` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:t9, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with
[ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) and published on
[HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can be found at
<https://hexdocs.pm/t9>.
